# Udemy-Analysis-Dashboard

I came across this Udemy Dataset from the Onyx Data January 2024 Challenge, and I decided to play around with it.

After going through the data, I realized that there would be alot of KPI's to draw out of the data but I only went with just a few, and also added some visualizations too.

KPI's:
- Total Revenue.
- Total Subscribers.
- Total Courses.
- Lecture Per Course.
- Total Reviews.
- Paid Courses.
- Free Courses.
- Average Price.
- Average Content Duration.

Visualizations:
- Yearly Revenue.
- Subscribers by Year.
- Value of Course Price.
- Total Subscribers by Difficulty.
- Top 10 Subscribed Courses

My conclusion from the data is that, web development brings in more money for the company than any other subject because it has the most subscribers 
and the longest-lasting content.

And my recommendation will be that the duration of content for the musical instruments should be extended.
Additionally, in order to draw in more users and raise revenue, more curriculum content should be introduced to the musical instrument and other subjects.
